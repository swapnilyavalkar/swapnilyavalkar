### ‚öôÔ∏è **Automation & Tools**

Here are some custom automations I‚Äôve built for various client needs:

- üóù **SSL Certificate Monitoring**: Automated script to check SSL expiration dates and send alerts.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Code Snippets**

Here's a simple **Python script** I created to automate SSL Certificate Monitoring:

```python
import ssl
import socket
from datetime import datetime

def ssl_expiry(domain):
    context = ssl.create_default_context()
    with socket.create_connection((domain, 443)) as sock:
        with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=domain) as ssock:
            cert = ssock.getpeercert()
            expire_date = cert['notAfter']
            expire_date = datetime.strptime(expire_date, "%b %d %H:%M:%S %Y GMT")
            return expire_date

domain = 'example.com'
expiry = ssl_expiry(domain)
print(f"The SSL certificate for {domain} expires on {expiry}")
```
