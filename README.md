### üõ†Ô∏è **Code Snippets**

Here's a simple **Python script** I created to automate SSL Certificate Monitoring:

```python
import pandas as pd
import tableauserverclient as TSC
import logging
import time
import os
import datetime

# Define the log directory path where the files are located
directory_path = "logs/"

# Define the threshold time to delete files that are older than 10 days
threshold_time = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=10)

""" SPECIFY TABLEAU SERVER LOGIN DETAILS BELOW """
server_url = ''
sites = ''
username = ''
password = ''

LOG_FILE_GEN_TIME = time.strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s, %(levelname)-8s [%(filename)s:%(module)s:%(funcName)s:%(name)s:%(lineno)d] %(message)s',
    datefmt='%Y-%m-%d:%H:%M:%S',
    filename='logs/SubscriptionsRemoval{0}.log'.format(LOG_FILE_GEN_TIME),
    filemode='a'
)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def delete_logs():
    global directory_path
    # Loop through all files in the logs directory
    try:
        for file_name in os.listdir(directory_path):
            # Get the creation time of the file
            file_path = os.path.join(directory_path, file_name)
            creation_time = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getctime(file_path))
            # Check if the file is older than the threshold time
            if creation_time < threshold_time:
                # Delete the file if it's older than the threshold time
                os.remove(file_path)
                print(f"Log Deleted file: {file_name}")
                logger.info(f"Log file older than 10 days deleted file: {file_name}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error while deleting log files: {str(e)}")
```
